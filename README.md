#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the development and mainteance of high quality software systems through a systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools. The process involves the designe, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
Softwre engineering develops various software applications and systems that make mordern life possible, improve productivity, improve health care delivery and quality, faciitate trade and commerce, etc. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. Early development of programming languages such as Fortran. This marked the development of the mordern programming languages. Fortran was developed in mid-1950s by a team in IBM. It was specifically designed to handle scientific and engeenering computations. It is compiler-based and uses high level constructs making it easier to write complex programs and ensuring efficient execution.
2. The development of structured programming in the 1970s. This era started with the development of structured language such as C. C was developed in early 1970s by ennis Ritchie at Bell Labs for system programming and operating system development. It is compier-based and uses procedural programming paradigm. It is the fondation for many other languages such as C++, Java, Python, etc and is still widely used for system software, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications 
3. The development of agile methodologies in 2000s. This provides the framework for managing and executing software development projects. It emphasizes felxibility, collaboratio, iterative development and value delinvery. Popular agile methodologies include scrum, kanban and extreme programming.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements: This involves the process of collecting, understanding and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: This is the stage where the software architecture and user interface are worked out.
3. Implementation: This involves writing code and building the software according tothe design specifications.
4. Testing: At this stage, the software s subject to various tests to confirm that it meets users' and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: This is the stage where the software is made available to the users.
6. Mainteenance: This involves the provision of ongoing support, updates and enhancement to the software after the lunch.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall uses a flowchat approach where the phases involved in the development of a softwre are sequentially set out and followed. It is best suited for projects with clear and stable requirements, low risk, and well-understood technology such as construction, manufacturing, and some software projects with rigid specifications.
Agile on the other hand adopts iterative and incremental approach with emphasis on flexibility, collaboration and timely response to change. It is best suited for projects with uncertain or changing requirements, complex projects, and projects where customer feedback is crucial. Examples include software development, web application development, and product development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

1. Software Developer handles code writing and implementation of software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer designs and execute test plans aim at ensuring the quality of the software.
3. Project manager manaes software development project from end to end. He manages the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) is a software package that provides comprehensive tools for writing, testing code and fixing any problems. It helps Software Engineer to develop software, test-run it and fix any identified problems. Examples of IDEs include:
1. Android Studio and Xcode to build apps for phones
2. Visual Studio, Sublime Text, Atom and IntelliJ IDEA to build apps for websites and web.
3. Eclipse and NetBeans to handle general-purpose programming.

Version Control System (VCS) are software tools used for tracking changes to source code and collaborate on a project. Examples include Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Common challenges faced by software engineer include tight deadline, changing requirements, technical debts, rapidly changing technology, balancing performance and scalability, debugging complex issues, security threats, etc.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit testing involves the testing of individual components or modules of a software.
2. Integration testing is designed to test that the different components of a software system works effectively and as expected.
3. System testing is used to test the enitre software system functionality.
4. Acceptance testing is used to test whether software meets user's needs or not.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is a practice of feeding AI models with streamlined and specific questions in order to get the best possible responses.
It helps users to maximise the potential of AI models. With prompt engineering, user is able to obtain relevant, suit for purpose responses from AI models. It makes it easier to solve simple to complex problems in a couple of minutes thereby save time and increase productivity.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt: Prepare a presentation for me on coding.

Modified version: Prepare a presentation for me on coding using fortran. Add graphics that are suitable for 6-year old Asia kids learning in a classroom setting. Limit the slides to seven and use plain english language
